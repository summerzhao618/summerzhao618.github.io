Welcome to my academic website! I'm **Xiayu Zhao**, a Master's student in Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, with a PhD in Robotics and AI for Construction (January 2024 - present). I work in the Robotic, Automation, and Intelligent Sensing (RAISe) Lab under the supervision of [Dr. Houtan Jebelli](https://cee.illinois.edu/directory/profile/hjebelli). I work closely with [Dr. Yizhi Liu](https://ecs.syracuse.edu/faculty-staff/yizhi-liu).

## About My Research

My research focuses on AI and robotics for construction, with emphasis on:

* **Multimodal perception for robotic inspection**: Computer vision and deep learning for automated inspection—including real-time roof defect segmentation (RRD-SegNet)—and sensor fusion for aerial–ground multi-robot systems.
* **AI and machine learning for human–robot collaboration**: Grounding large language models in robot control for natural-language interaction, and LLM-driven safe navigation with terrain-adaptive path planning.
* **Construction robotics and cyber–physical systems**: Hybrid UAV–UGV systems with interchangeable ground modules, adaptive kinematic and dynamic control for hexapods in complex environments, and reinforcement learning for robot navigation and UAV stability with payloads.
* **Worker safety and physiological monitoring**: Transfer learning for heat-strain prediction and understanding exoskeleton effects on metabolic cost in repetitive construction tasks.
* **Digital fabrication and computational design**: Computational design, algorithm optimization, and robotic fabrication (e.g., 3D concrete printing); earlier work on biomimetic and morphological simulation for design applications.

My work combines robotics, computer vision, machine learning, and human–computer interaction to improve construction safety, efficiency, and quality. I develop software interfaces for robotic construction, control and perception for UAV/UGV/hexapod systems, and methods that connect language models to robot control in construction environments.

## Research Experience

I am currently a PhD student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, working on several projects in the RAISe Lab as part of my research focus in endowing construction robots with multi-modal perception and native language reasoning including:
- Real-time roof defect segmentation using deep learning (RRD-SegNet)
- Adaptive intelligence for robot navigation efficiency using deep reinforcement learning
- Grounding large language models in robot control for human-robot collaboration

Previously, I worked as a Research Engineer at the Institute of Future Human Habitats at Tsinghua University, where I engaged large-scale robotic construction technologies and software interfaces for robotic control, with research in digital fabrication, computational design, and algorithm optimization.
