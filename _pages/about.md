Welcome to my academic website! I'm **Xiayu Zhao**, a Master's student in Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, with a PhD in Robotics and AI for Construction (January 2024 - present). I work in the Robotic, Automation, and Intelligent Sensing (RAISe) Lab under the supervision of [Dr. Houtan Jebelli](https://cee.illinois.edu/directory/profile/hjebelli). I work closely with [Dr. Yizhi Liu](https://ecs.syracuse.edu/faculty-staff/yizhi-liu).

## About My Research

My research focuses on AI and robotics for construction applications, with particular emphasis on:

* **AI and Machine Learning for Human-Robot Collaboration**: Developing algorithms that enable seamless collaboration between humans and robots in construction environments
* **Computer Vision for Automated Inspection**: Creating computer vision techniques for automated inspection tasks, including real-time roof defect segmentation
* **Construction Robotics**: Advancing robotic construction technologies, including 3D printing, robotic control, and navigation systems
* **Digital Architecture and Computational Design**: Exploring computational design methods and their integration with robotic fabrication
* **Immersive Technologies for Safety Training**: Developing VR-based training systems for construction safety, particularly for human-robot collaborative scenarios

My work combines robotics, computer vision, machine learning, and human-computer interaction to improve construction safety, efficiency, and quality. I have experience in developing software interfaces for robotic construction, programming robot arms for large-scale 3D printing, and creating immersive training environments using ROS and Unity.

## Research Experience

I am currently a PhD student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, working on several projects in the RAISe Lab as part of my research focus in endowing construction robots with multi-modal perception and native language reasoning including:
- Real-time roof defect segmentation using deep learning (RRD-SegNet)
- Adaptive intelligence for robot navigation efficiency using deep reinforcement learning
- Grounding large language models in robot control for human-robot collaboration

Previously, I worked as a Research Engineer at the Institute of Future Human Habitats at Tsinghua University, where I engaged large-scale robotic construction technologies and software interfaces for robotic control, with research in digital fabrication, computational design, and algorithm optimization.
